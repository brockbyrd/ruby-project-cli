Welcome to the NBA player finder CLI!

This program is written using the balldontlie API. This CLI allows the user to find players with the name that they enter.

You start the program by running the executable file with ruby bin/executable.
You then enter the first or last name of the player you would like to look at.
The program will then print a list of players with that name and give you the option to select a player by typing in the number they are listed as.
The program will then print out the player attributes that are given by the API.
You will then have the option to select another player, select new players, or exit the program.

The gems that need to be installed are vine, httparty and json.
